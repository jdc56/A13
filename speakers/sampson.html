		<h2>February<br>
		Scott Sampson</h2>

		<p>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the 
		Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the 
		Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the 
		ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number 
		of countries in Africa.

		Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the 
		University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or horned 
		dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid 
		horns and frills.

		Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natural 
		History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New 
		York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah 
		accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics 
		and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research 
		interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of 
		Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.</p>
